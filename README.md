Netgen Enhanced Binary File Bundle
================================

Netgen Enhanced Binary FIle Bundle is an eZ Publish 5 bundle that provides a field type that reimplements `ezbinaryfile` field type.

This repository represents eZ Publish 5 rewrite of the original eZ Publish 4 extension called `enhancedezbinaryfile`.

However, The eZ Publish 4 extension is still required to populate field type through the admin interface.

When you install this bundle with Composer, the eZ Publish 4 extension is installed automatically but not activated in settings.
